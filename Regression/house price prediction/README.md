Ames Housing Price Prediction: Advanced Regression Techniques
This project focuses on predicting the sale price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. Using a dataset with 79 explanatory variables, the goal is to build a robust regression model that can accurately estimate property values through detailed feature engineering and advanced modeling. 
Project Overview
Predicting house prices is a classic "regression" problem. The challenge lies in handling a diverse mix of data—everything from square footage and number of rooms to qualitative measures like "kitchen quality" or "neighborhood prestige."

Key Data Science 
Steps1. Data Cleaning & Outlier RemovalData isn't always perfect. We started by removing massive outliers (e.g., houses with over 4,500 sq. ft. of living area) that didn't follow the typical price-to-size relationship.Code logic: train = train[train['GrLivArea'] < 4500]
2. Target TransformationTo satisfy the statistical assumptions of linear models, we applied a Log Transformation ($log(1+x)$) to the SalePrice.Benefit: This converts a "skewed" distribution into a "normal" bell curve, making the model less sensitive to extreme luxury home prices.
3. Smart Imputation (Filling Missing Values)We didn't just fill every empty box with zero. We used specific strategies:Categorical defaults: Filling "Functional" with "Typical" as per documentation.Grouped Medians: Filling missing "Lot Frontage" (street length) based on the Median of the specific neighborhood.Grouped Modes: Filling "Zoning" based on the house's "SubClass" type.
4. Feature EngineeringBox-Cox Transformation: Automatically detected and fixed "skewed" numerical columns to make them more symmetrical.One-Hot Encoding: Used pd.get_dummies to turn text categories (like "Neighborhood" or "RoofStyle") into numbers that a calculator can understand.
5. Advanced ModelingWe implemented Regularized Regression models to prevent overfitting:Lasso Regression: Automatically performs feature selection by setting the importance of useless variables to zero.Ridge Regression: Helps manage "multicollinearity" (when two features, like Garage Cars and Garage Area, are almost identical).

Results & Evaluation
The models were evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the log-transformed price.

Evaluation Function: We used a custom evaluation tool to visualize residuals (the difference between predicted and actual prices) to ensure the model wasn't making biased mistakes.

How to use this project
Environment: Ensure you have pandas, numpy, seaborn, and sklearn installed.

Data: Place the train.csv and test.csv in the project root.

Run: Execute the notebook cells sequentially to process the data, train the models, and generate the submission.csv.

The project generates a final submission file where:

Prices are predicted using the trained Ridge/Lasso model.

Log prices are converted back to dollars using np.expm1.

Data is formatted into the required Id and SalePrice columns for competition entry.
